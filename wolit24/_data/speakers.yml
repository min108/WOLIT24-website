  spk-title: Trilemma in Distributed Learning:Data Privacy, Communication Efficiency, and Accuracy
  spk-abstract: 
    - Distributed learning is envisioned to play an important role in next-generation AI-native wireless systems. By exploiting computing power and sensory data distributed across the network, this learning paradigm dramatically reduces communication burden and enhances data privacy, thus enabling network intelligence in a scalable manner. This talk focuses on the intriguing relationship of communication efficiency, data privacy and learning performance in the distributed training of deep neural networks. We first introduce our work on user training data reconstruction based on gradient information from the attacker's perspective, indicating that there is still a risk of data privacy leakage even if the principle of data minimization in distributed learning is followed. We examine and observe that different compressors vary in performance against the data reconstruction attacks. Then, to measure the privacy-preservation capability of gradient compression, we introduce our work on differential privacy of gradient compressors from the perspective of defensive mechanisms, revealing the inherent relationship between lossy compression and privacy protection.

  spk-title: Robust Multiplication-Free Kernels Related with L1-Norm and Haar Wavelet Based Network Layers
  spk-abstract: 
    - We describe a family of vector dot products that can be implemented using only sign calculations and addition/subtraction operations. The dot products are also energy-efficient because they do not perform energy consuming multiplication operations. Moreover, the vector products induce the L1-norm. As a result, they are robust to outliers in data. We prove that some of the vector products satisfy Mercer's condition and yield symmetric, positive semi-definite generalized covariance matrices, thus enabling Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and related energy-efficient signal and image processing applications. We can also use the new vector products in "convolution"-like operations in deep neural networks. In the second part of the talk, We will describe Haar Wavelet (or Hadamard transform) layers for neural networks to further reduce the energy consumption in edge applications. We will present practical Machine Learning applications. ML applications include (i) wildfire detection at the edge using cameras and (ii) sleep monitoring using infrared sensors.

  spk-title: "Aligning Model with Human Preference: A Ranking based Zeroth-order Optimization Method"
  spk-abstract: 
    - In this study, we delve into an emerging optimization challenge involving a black-box objective function that can only be gauged via a ranking oracle—a situation frequently encountered in real-world scenarios, especially when the function is evaluated by human judges. A prominent instance of such a situation is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), an approach recently employed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using human. We introduce ZO-RankSGD, an innovative zeroth-order optimization algorithm designed to tackle this optimization problem, accompanied by theoretical assurances. Our algorithm utilizes a novel rank-based random estimator to determine the descent direction and guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Last but not least, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application:improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers a new and effective approach for aligning Artificial Intelligence (AI) with human intentions.

  spk-title: On Partly Smoothness, Activity Identification and Faster Algorithms of L1 over L2  Minimization
  spk-abstract: 
    - The L1/L2 norm ratio arose as a sparseness measure and attracted a considerable amount of attention due to  three merits:(i) sharper approximations of $L_0$ compared to the $L_1$; (ii) parameter-free and scale-invariant; (iii) more attractive than $L_1$ under highly-coherent matrices. In this paper, we first establish the partly smooth property of $L_1$ over $L_2$ minimization relative to an active manifold ${\cal M}$ and also demonstrate its prox-regularity property. Second, we reveal that ADMM$_p$ (or ADMM$^+_p$) can identify the active manifold within a finite iterations. This discovery contributes to a deeper understanding of the optimization landscape associated with $L_1$ over $L_2$ minimization. Third, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm framework that combines ADMM$_p$ (or ADMM$^+_p$) with a globalized semismooth Newton method tailored for the active manifold ${\cal M}$. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods to enhance convergence. Finally, through extensive numerical simulations, we showcase the superiority of our heuristic algorithm over existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse recovery.

  spk-title: Large-scale 3D Neuron Reconstruction and Morphology Analysis from Electron Microscopy Images
  spk-abstract:
    - With the advent of advanced serial section electron microscopy (EM) imaging techniques, several EM data of mm3-scale volumes have been published for the connectomics community, with the data sizes ranging from terabytes to petabytes. The current neuron reconstruction pipeline for EM data usually includes automatic image segmentation followed by extensive human expert proofreading. Our work aims to reduce human workload by predicting connectivity between over-segmented neuron pieces, taking both microscopy image and 3D morphology features into account, similar to human proofreading workflow. In this talk, I will introduce our recently proposed deep learning approaches for morphological analysis for neuron classification and retrieval, connectivity prediction of neuron segments, and long-range neuron 3D tracing.

  spk-title: InfoBodied AI:Learning Mutual Information for Embodied AI
  spk-abstract: 
    - Embodied AI strives to create agents capable of learning and tackling complex tasks involving physical interactions, with potential applications in many areas, such as housekeeping, caregiving, and logistics. Such agents must be able to perceive their environment, construct scene representations, and carry out reasoning and actions to accomplish task-specific goals. However, existing learning approaches rely on human annotations or unrealistic simulations, leading to generalization problems in the real world. Thus, it is crucial to equip embodied agents with the ability to autonomously learn from real-world data, minimizing reliance on human supervision and enabling adaptability to new tasks. We propose that the key to autonomous learning of embodied agents is the mutual correlations in the unlabeled data. In this presentation, we will talk about how we can efficiently compute mutual information of data by developing novel neural estimators. We will also show how these freely available mutual correlations can help reduce human annotation effort in learning label-efficient perception, scene representation, and grounded concepts for generalizable interaction policies. Finally, we show a potential framework to build embodied agents that can learn in unseen environments and automatically acquire novel interaction skills by leveraging mutual information in unlabeled observational data.
