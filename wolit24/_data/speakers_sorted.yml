  - "Distributed learning is envisioned to play an important role in next-generation AI-native wireless systems. By exploiting computing power and sensory data distributed across the network, this learning paradigm dramatically reduces communication burden and enhances data privacy, thus enabling network intelligence in a scalable manner. This talk focuses on the intriguing relationship of communication efficiency, data privacy and learning performance in the distributed training of deep neural networks. We first introduce our work on user training data reconstruction based on gradient information from the attacker's perspective, indicating that there is still a risk of data privacy leakage even if the principle of data minimization in distributed learning is followed. We examine and observe that different compressors vary in performance against the data reconstruction attacks. Then, to measure the privacy-preservation capability of gradient compression, we introduce our work on differential privacy of gradient compressors from the perspective of defensive mechanisms, revealing the inherent relationship between lossy compression and privacy protection.

  - "We describe a family of vector dot products that can be implemented using only sign calculations and addition/subtraction operations. The dot products are also energy-efficient because they do not perform energy consuming multiplication operations. Moreover, the vector products induce the ℓ1-norm. As a result, they are robust to outliers in data. We prove that some of the vector products satisfy Mercer's condition and yield symmetric, positive semi-definite generalized covariance matrices, thus enabling Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and related energy-efficient signal and image processing applications. We can also use the new vector products in “convolution”-like operations in deep neural networks. In the second part of the talk, we will describe Haar Wavelet (or Hadamard transform) layers for neural networks to further reduce the energy consumption in edge applications. We will present practical Machine Learning applications. ML applications include (i) wildfire detection at the edge using cameras and (ii) sleep monitoring using infrared sensors."

  - "In this study, we delve into an emerging optimization challenge involving a black-box objective function that can only be gauged via a ranking oracle—a situation frequently encountered in real-world scenarios, especially when the function is evaluated by human judges. A prominent instance of such a situation is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), an approach recently employed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using human. We introduce ZO-RankSGD, an innovative zeroth-order optimization algorithm designed to tackle this optimization problem, accompanied by theoretical assurances. Our algorithm utilizes a novel rank-based random estimator to determine the descent direction and guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Last but not least, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers a new and effective approach for aligning Artificial Intelligence (AI) with human intentions."

  - "The L1/L2 norm ratio arose as a sparseness measure and attracted a considerable amount of attention due to three merits: (i) sharper approximations of L0 compared to the L1; (ii) parameter-free and scale-invariant; (iii) more attractive than L1 under highly-coherent matrices. In this paper, we first establish the partly smooth property of L1 over L2 minimization relative to an active manifold M and also demonstrate its prox-regularity property. Second, we reveal that ADMMp (or ADMMp+) can identify the active manifold within a finite iterations. This discovery contributes to a deeper understanding of the optimization landscape associated with L1 over L2 minimization. Third, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm framework that combines ADMMp (or ADMMp+) with a globalized semismooth Newton method tailored for the active manifold M. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods to enhance convergence. Finally, through extensive numerical simulations, we showcase the superiority of our heuristic algorithm over existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse recovery."

  - "Image reconstruction tasks such as super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, colorization, and compressed sensing are critical in computer vision applications. These tasks often involve solving ill-posed inverse problems due to incomplete or noisy observations, requiring the incorporation of prior knowledge about the image structure. Traditionally, this prior knowledge has been incorporated through sparsity-based methods, which assume that the target image can be represented by a sparse set of basis functions. While effective, sparsity-based approaches often struggle with complex image structures and might fail to  capture the full richness of natural signals. Diffusion models (DM), also known as score-based generative models (SGM), offer a new paradigm by leveraging their powerful distribution modeling capabilities. Unlike sparsity-based methods, diffusion models can learn and represent the intricate structural features of natural images. As a result, by using diffusion models as an implicit prior and applying the Bayesian principle for posterior inference, we can achieve more effective image reconstruction. This talk is structured into three parts: The first part provides a concise overview of image reconstruction and sparsity-based solutions, followed by a tutorial introduction to diffusion models. The second part focuses on linear image reconstruction problems, presenting a diffusion model-based posterior sampling algorithm (DMPS). The final part addresses nonlinear image reconstruction problems, specifically quantized compressed sensing (QCS), introducing a QCS algorithm based on SGM (QCS-SGM) and its enhanced version QCS-SGM+, suitable for both row-orthogonal and general measurement matrices."

  - "Embodied AI strives to create agents capable of learning and tackling complex tasks involving physical interactions, with potential applications in many areas, such as housekeeping, caregiving, and logistics. Such agents must be able to perceive their environment, construct scene representations, and carry out reasoning and actions to accomplish task-specific goals. However, existing learning approaches rely on human annotations or unrealistic simulations, leading to generalization problems in the real world. Thus, it is crucial to equip embodied agents with the ability to autonomously learn from real-world data, minimizing reliance on human supervision and enabling adaptability to new tasks. We propose that the key to autonomous learning of embodied agents is the mutual correlations in the unlabeled data. In this presentation, we will talk about how we can efficiently compute mutual information of data by developing novel neural estimators. We will also show how these freely available mutual correlations can help reduce human annotation effort in learning label-efficient perception, scene representation, and grounded concepts for generalizable interaction policies. Finally, we show a potential framework to build embodied agents that can learn in unseen environments and automatically acquire novel interaction skills by leveraging mutual information in unlabeled observational data."
